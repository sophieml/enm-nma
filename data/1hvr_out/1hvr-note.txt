Chains and HETATMs selected: 
  ATOM        A

Normal mode analysis calculation

Parameters of potential energies:
  E(d) = A*exp(-d(PDB)**2/B**2)(d-d(PDB))**2  for 1-4 and 1-5 interactions.
  E(d) = A*(d-d(PDB))**2  for a chemical bond treated with a loop-closing
  potential such as a disulfide bond and one of the bonds in the DNA and RNA
  sugar ring. d and d(PDB) are distances between atoms in calculation and 
  in PDB data, respectively.

  Interaction        A       B      Cutoff distance (A)
    1-4             1.00    5.00      100.00
    1-5             1.00    5.00      100.00
    Loop-closing  100.00
